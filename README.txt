Inside the "Java Code" directory is the source code of the bot that I use to manage my Clash Royale clan.
Note that if you simply download it and try to compile it wont run since there are a lot of import that I didn't include in this commit.
Inside the "bot.jar" is the .jar file thats fully built to make the bot run
